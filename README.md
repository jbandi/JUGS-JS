# JUGS-JS

This repository contains the material for the Hands-On JavaScript Workshop at the Java User Group Switzerland.

## Hands-On Lab
Please clone the repository in the week before the event, to get the material for the hands-on lab.

## JavaScript Tools Infrastructure
If you want to follow along with all the demos, you should also install the following JavaScript tooling:

- Node.js and NPM ([installer available here](https://nodejs.org/))
- WebStorm ([30 day trial-version available here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)])

You should then also install some JavaScript tools via NPM:

    npm install -g grunt-cli gulp bower yo http-server karma-cli protractor



To prepare for the build demo go into the directory `01-Intro/02-SimplisticToDo-Gulp` and execute the following commands:

	npm install
	bower install

The above commands should run without error!  
Note: Many corporate proxies are blocking access to npmjs.org and/or to bower repositories. Please make sure that you have unrestricted access to the internet.
